# scry

A tool to aid in filetype determination using heuristics,
inspired by the description of John Ortiz's Write Bitmap
Histogram [here][wbh-description]. Worth noting in passing that,
apart from providing similar functionality, Scry is entirely
independent from WBH; I have never actually used WBH, nor seen
or downloaded the source or executable. So, from a legal / licensing
perspective, the two tools are completely unrelated.
